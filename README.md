- 👋 Hi, I’m @GammaProteo
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatic application in a field of metagenomics, NMR spectroscopy and CRYOelectron microscopy
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python3, bash, awk and perl.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, because I am highly unskilled, trust me on that.
- 📫 How to reach me... Well, you can write me an email on my academic account cernyarchaea@mail.muni.cz. Otherwise I have no other mean. 
     But seriously, why would you want to contact me in the first place. Seriously, why. Is something wrong with you, jeez...
